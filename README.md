##Project review

-The game meets the proposed requierements and achieved the backlog features, even tough with a different classes structure, finally the InteractionBox class used for the final door is not an extension of the Box class.

-The game presents a consistency in the themes used, that helps building a story. And the music and sound effects helps the player engage.

-The difficulty (by enemy's frequency and speed) has been carefully balanced in order to present an increassing challenge for each level you advance.

-The game provides with the basic elements that can be easily modified or extended in order to amplify the gaming experience by introducing new elements in future versions.
